# Working with [Freddy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/freddym/)

This document explains how I operate, my expectations, and how to work effectively with me. Use it as a reference for onboarding and our ongoing collaboration. If something is unclear or missing, call it out.

## Core Rules of Engagement

* Clarity first – I owe you context, priorities, and direction. If I'm not providing it, push me.
* Feedback is fast and candid – don't wait for reviews; **write it down** and share it.
* Outcomes > outputs – we measure success in value delivered, not activity.
* Own your work – autonomy is the default; escalate when you're blocked or need overall direction.
* 1:1s are yours – bring topics, questions, or issues; I'll add mine after.
* Respect boundaries – I won't expect you online outside working hours.

## My Role

I'm responsible for:

* Providing clarity and context.
* Hiring, retaining, and growing world-class talent.
* Establishing mechanisms that keep the org running smoothly.

**I'm successful when you are successful**. My job is to ensure you have:

* Context to prioritize.
* Freedom to discover and deliver.
* A roadmap or a way to create one.
* Clarity on roles, relationships, and responsibilities.

## Principles I Operate By

* **Context + direction, not command + control** – My job is to set vision, provide clarity, and remove obstacles. I will give you freedom and ownership, but I will also be clear and opinionated on strategy and technical direction. I rely on senior ICs and managers to amplify that direction and drive alignment across teams.
* **Small teams, big impact** – fewer people, higher talent density, faster delivery.
* **Bias for action** – doing beats talking; 90% of the work is starting.
* **Dream big, start small** – iterate toward ambitious goals.
* **Data + working backward** – clear end states, measurable paths.
* **Ownership and judgment** – autonomy in exchange for sound decisions.
* **Polished over perfect** – clear, clean, understandable deliverables.
* **Leaders step up** – fill gaps, drive change, ask hard questions.

## Work & Communication

* If I delegate a task, record it. If I need it ASAP, I will let you know; otherwise, I will expect an ETA from you.
* I'm US EST, 9–5. I may work off-hours (sometimes odd hours), but that's my choice — don't mirror it.
* Use email for non-urgent matters; I reply within 24h.
* Use Slack for time-sensitive issues; SMS for urgent ones.
* Group chats: I may skim unless directly mentioned.

#### Preferences (not mandates):
* **Documents**: 10–11 pt font, spell-checked, diagrams clean.
* **Slides**: visuals > walls of text. _Note: in general I do prefer documents._

## Meetings
* **1:1s:** At least quarterly (more often if you are a direct report). Bring your topics first. We will keep a shared doc for continuity.
* **Team/staff meetings**: Weekly, agenda-driven, no status updates.
* **Operations reviews**: Weekly or bi-weekly, very structured and metric driven.

#### In general:

* Always include an agenda + success criteria.
* Send docs in advance; I will read and comment beforehand.
* Start on time, end early if possible.
* If I'm invited without clear purpose, I'll ask why. 

## Feedback & Performance

* Feedback is continuous, fast, and safe. Write it down before sharing.
* Expect small, frequent, actionable feedback from me — no surprises at review time.
* Keep a [brag book](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/keeping-brag-book-adam-berguem-1e) of accomplishments. It is for your growth, recognition, and promotions, nobody is a better advocate to you than yourself.
* We will define OKRs/SMART goals and review quarterly.

## Time Off

* I won't block vacation if it follows company policy.
* Give ~2 weeks notice for extended absences.
* Use the shared vacation calendar and company system.

## If I Drop the Ball
I'm human! If I miss something, remind me. If it is urgent, ping me twice — if you get no response, then escalate.

## Technical
I dive into code/design to understand rationale and challenge assumptions. It's not a sign of mistrust. Expect occasional deep reviews of architecture, patterns, and principles.
